# Niche Mastery

**What is holding you back from succeeding on Twitter?**

For most people it’s answers like:

“I don’t know what to create!” or “No matter what I post I still get 0 likes!”

Even when you know what you want to talk about, it can still be hard to find that footing. And traction doesn’t come easy.

**People don’t know you, don’t trust you, and will ignore you as you shout into the void. Unless you give them a reason to interact with you.**

It can be incredibly frustrating, demoralizing, and leads most people to just quit outright. I know because I struggled with this throughout 2021.

In trying to find answers I talked to lots of people, and researched for dozens if not hundreds of hours.

Everything I found helped me sharpen the diamond in the rough that I was, and create content that not only brought growth, but allowed me to truly show who I was as a creator. There was a newfound sense of direction and meaning behind my work.

**NicheMastery is a collection of ideas to help you build momentum online.**

It is designed to help you:

1. Understand what you want to focus on.
2. Get clarity on how to organize your expertise.
3. Know how to create content that resonates.
4. Stand-out from others in your industry.
5. Refine your brand to an exact point.

In short, it will help you understand what it takes to be a great creator, and will help you grow your online presence quickly.

This is much more than me telling you to: “Just create every day.”

I’ve collected dozens of the best mindsets, interviews, frameworks, and tips, to help you build your authority, confidence, capabilities, and understanding.


# Book

**The book collects everything you might need to know to start growing.**

It starts with the essentials to get you started - including your goals, how they fit in, your content pillars, adjusting for your knowledge level, and planning for premissionless progress.
