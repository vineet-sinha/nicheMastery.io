**What is holding you back from succeeding on Twitter?**

For most people it’s answers like:

“I don’t know what to create!” or “No matter what I post I still get 0 likes!”

Even when you know what you want to talk about, it can still be hard to find that footing. And traction doesn’t come easy.

**People don’t know you, don’t trust you, and will ignore you as you shout into the void. Unless you give them a reason to interact with you.**

It can be incredibly frustrating, demoralizing, and leads most people to just quit outright. I know because I struggled with this throughout 2021.

In trying to find answers I talked to lots of people, and researched for dozens if not hundreds of hours.

Everything I found helped me sharpen the diamond in the rough that I was, and create content that not only brought growth, but allowed me to truly show who I was as a creator. There was a newfound sense of direction and meaning behind my work.
